create a folder based on this repo then add some basic MVC file structure to base my work on. 
use a checklist for functionality and then start working on the essentials first, only focusing on nice-to-have afterwards. 
make sure it works first and then make sure it looks somewhat nice afterwards. functionality first. 
until 12:30. finish the basics. make sure the files are made and saved properly, how they display is something i can do after that is finished. 


description of the challenge: Consolidation Challenge, -show me what you've learned-
You are required within one day to create a guestbook within php. 
the requirements of this project: 
any visitor on the page can leave a message that is saved and shown the last message appearing on top of the page. 
messages should be stored in a file on the system, using file_put_contents is advised. 
both methods of json_encode and serialize can be used to convert the data into a string from an array. 
MUSTHAVE: 
a post: title, date, content, author name. 

minimum of 2 classes, eg. PostLoader & Post. 

messages are sorted new at the top and old at the bottom. 

make sure the script can handle defacement attacks. use htmlspecialchars for this. 
show only the last 20 posts. 

nice-to-haves: 
-profanity filter
-smiley-to-smiley-image -> figure out emoji's i guess. 
input field to show how many posts the user wishes to see. 

advice: 
seperate view (HTML) from code as much as possible. 
MVC is optional but this is the groundwork for that it seems. 
footer and header in html and require in template files to not have to repeat code. 
check out the json_encode and serialize depending on which choice you make.
